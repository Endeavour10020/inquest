Welcome to the Inquest documentation. Inquest is a real-time logging framework for python. It let's you add
log statements and other metrics to running code in the same way you add
break points in a debugger.

After two lines of integration in python, you're able to to add a log statement and in milliseconds that new log statement is inserted in to your running python without requiring any restarts.

To get started, there are 2 ways of running inquest:

1. [Running It With Inquest Cloud](getting_started.md)
2. [Hosting it on a your computer via docker-compose](getting_started_with_docker.md)

Right now, during beta, Inquest Cloud is completely free (and we'll permanently have a free-tier). If you want to just try it out without hosting, you can get started for free.
